            <h2>The Renegade Rip</h2>
            <p>
              I have been writing since I was about 6 years old with my first book that
              I "designed the cover"(drew a picture on construction paper), "wrote the manuscript"(wrote a story on lined paper) 
              and "published the book"(stapled the construction paper and line paper together) all myself. 
              The Renegade Rip was the college newspaper at Bakersfield College that is designed and published from beginning to end 
              by students for the required major course for a Journalism degree. The issues are archived and available online at
              <a href="https://www.therip.com/">The Rip Newspaper</a>
