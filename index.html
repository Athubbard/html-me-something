            <p>
              I have been writing since I was about 6 years old with my first book that
              I "designed the cover"(drew a picture on construction paper), "wrote the manuscript"(wrote a story on lined paper) 
              and "published the book"(stapled the construction paper and line paper together) all myself. 
              The Renegade Rip was the college newspaper at Bakersfield College that is designed and published from beginning to end 
              by students as a required major course for a Journalism degree. The issues are archived and available online at
              <a href="https://www.therip.com/">The Renegade Rip</a>.

              <p>
                The second opportunity to write was small, but I guess you could say published
                in an inhouse newsletter for a company that I worked for. It was titled Schaefer Autoby Times
                and I wrote the articles that were to highlight the excellect customer service surveys we got
                form satisfied customers. It was nothing to tricky, but I am still proud of my work
                and the opportunity to have it published although from my knowledge it is not something that 
                can be viewed by the public.
