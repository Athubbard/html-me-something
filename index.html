              I have been writing since I was about 6 years old with my first book that
              I "designed the cover"(drew a picture on construction paper), "wrote the manuscript"(wrote a story on lined paper) 
              and "published the book"(stapled the construction paper and line paper together) all myself. 
              The Renegade Rip was the college newspaper at Bakersfield College that is designed and published from beginning to end 
              by students as a required major course for a Journalism degree. The issues are archived and available online at
              <a href="https://www.therip.com/">The Renegade Rip</a>.

              <h2>Schaefer Autobody Times</h2>
              <p>
                The second opportunity to write was small, but I guess you could say published
                in an inhouse newsletter for a company that I worked for. It was titled Schaefer Autoby Times
                and I wrote the articles that were to highlight the excellect customer service surveys we got
                form satisfied customers. It was nothing to tricky, but I am still proud of my work
                and the opportunity to have it published although from my knowledge it is not something that 
                cannot be viewed by the public.

              This work is actually really important to me for multiple reasons icluding the fact that this is my biggest
              accomplishment in writing to date. The first being because I have loved 
              comics since I can remember so I am always excited to write about them. Secondly, I noticed that there 
              are not as many African American characters at the forefront, but African American writers working
              for the big three(Marvel, DC and Darkhorse) has been almost non-existent up until recently. 
              Thirdly this book focuses on those that are independent creators and are sometimes overlooked 
              for their contribution to genre. Lastly because this book has been nominated and won a few awards since its 
              release. This opportunity also allows me to stay motivated to keep working on my own comic book. 
              It can be purchased on multiple sites including <a href="https://fulcrum.bookstore.ipgbook.com/encyclopedia-of-black-comics-products-9781682751015.php">Fulcrum Pubishing Company Site.</a>

             <p>This is currently a volunteer contributing position that I hold with this webite. I am excited to be a part of 
             this site because it showcases up and coming artist in the black indie genre. I am to review and wite about 
             others just like me who have a passion for comics and science fiction as told through the eyes of people of color. 
             Having the opportunity to be a part of something like this continues to encourage me not to give because it can be
             done and I am able to be front and center when it does. I can also be one of the first to experience these new writers 
             and artist. It enables me to build a newtwork in an industry that is highly pursued and therefoer is an absolute asset 
             in my opinion. You can visit my profile at <a href="https://blacksci-fi.com/author/amber-t-hubbard/">The writer's profile page</a>"

              <p>I was afforded this opportunity to be a writer featured in this anthology through the Black Sci-Fi Society website it is 
              actually a book that is published by the Black Sci-Fi Society. This is their second volume and I am honored to be  part of it. 
              One of the reasons is because any time I can write is a blessing and anytime I can be published is a mission accomplished.
              I secondly appreciate the chance to be apart of this because although I love Black Sci-Fi, I have never really written it
              before and this was my first attempt and it was good enough to be chosen. It let's me know that I am only getting better 
              with my writing.

            <h3>Works in Progress</h3>
              <p>
                I have a few works that I am working on and my main one right now is my own comic Kasiah: Mother Nature Incarnate. I am working to 
                produce a quality product that almost everyone can enjoy. This has been in the making for the last 6 years and although
                it started out as just a joke it has become like my child and I can't wait for time when I can reveal it to the world. I also 
                have a series of novels that I am working as well. So please stay tuned for new working coming soon. <a href=""></a>
